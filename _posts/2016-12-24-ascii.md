The most beautiful of trees I've come to know<br>
are the ones of Github flow!<br>
For my collaborators, far and quite near<br>
I wish you a holiday warm and dear!<br>

If pulling a thread of meaning from woven text <br>
is that which your heart does wish. <br>
Not so absurd or seemingly complex, <br>
if you befriend a tiny word fish. <br>

<p>The little WordFish, he started as an NLP python library using word2vec, and now is taking Stanford Radiology by storm as a tool for annotation of radiologist reports! It's going to be an exciting 2017 for this little fish.</p><br><br>

What's better than bread, but maybe plainer?<br>
Why, putting your ingredients all in a container!<br>
This isn't the main repo, it's just for our docs<br>
thank you to all our collaborators, students, and postdocs!<br><br>

A glorious end to graduate school<br>
I found in Poldrack lab<br>
And no better storage tool<br>
could be found in a browser tab!<br><br>

Much more to come from this factory of things<br>
Looking forward to seeing what 2017 brings!<br><br>

The explosions of my mind<br>
are akin to the poopy kind<br>
put that thought away, you sneaky dog,<br>
this code base is just for a github blog!<br>
