The most beautiful of trees I've come to know<br>
are the ones of Github flow!<br>
For my collaborators, far and quite near<br>
I wish you a holiday warm and dear!<br>

If pulling a thread of meaning from woven text <br>
is that which your heart does wish. <br>
Not so absurd or seemingly complex, <br>
if you befriend a tiny word fish. <br>

<p>This little <a href="http://vsoch.github.io/2016/2016-wordfish/" target="_blank">WordFish</a> started as an NLP python library using word2vec, and now is up to fishy business helping Stanford Radiology annotate reports! It's been quick and fun developing the tool, and is going to be an exciting 2017 for this little fish.</p><br><br>

What's better than bread, but maybe plainer?<br>
Why, putting your ingredients all in a container!<br>
This isn't the main repo, it's just for our docs<br>
thank you to all our collaborators, students, and postdocs!<br><br>

A glorious journey in graduate school<br>
with badass brains being the common rule<br>
before late 2015 it was pretty bad<br>
until being saved by Poldrack lab!<br>
The start that brought life back from a sudden halt<br>
was contributing to this NeuroVault.<br><br>

Much more to come from this factory of things<br>
Looking forward to seeing what 2017 brings!<br><br>

The explosions of my mind<br>
are akin to the poopy kind<br>
we all need a place for thoughts, a captain's log<br>
which is why I pound keys for this Github blog!<br>
